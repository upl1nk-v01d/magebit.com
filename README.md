# magebit.com task files

These files include code of (almost) completed test exercises from company 'magebit'.
The server installation and web coding took approx. 48 hours, about 3-5 hours every day in 10 days period.
There where some coding hangups with css formatting, php and mysql coding.
I assumed that deadline (01.10.2021) has come and I did what I did. :)
